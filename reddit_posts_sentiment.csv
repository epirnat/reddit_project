So Im headed to Slovenia and think of using Ljubljana as a base and rent car/s for the stay, 4-5 days.

So, Ive got a few touristy questions you can help answer..

First of all, rent a car, Ive seen some suggestions on eg. Avant2go, is this just rent and drop? High availability and/or is it possible to rent for the entire stay? Any other suggestions are welcome outside of airport.

Any specific nightmare roads to avoid and suggestions on scenic routes? I thought to bring some sunshine hopefully.

One spot to visit will be Bled and Postojna/Skocjan, or both.

Thinking 1 to 2 places per day, rest will be for some  sightseeing in Ljubljana... So here it goes, anything i cant miss?

Travel advice,7,17,1688364528.0,"Travel advice Hey
I am not sure this is the right sub for it, but I want to ask for a travel advice for a friend who plans to travel alone to Slovenia :)

 My friend asked me to ask it:

I will be solo traveling to the Balkans in August for 3 weeks (21 nights), starting in Slovenia, then Croatia and flying out from Montenegro . I would be happy to hear any opinion on my itinerary and I'm very open to changes like adding/deducting days and of course to other (geographically-reasonable) destinations. I wanna focus on hiking in Slovenia and spend up to 8 days in your country (so I have enough for the rest...). In terms of budget this is a backpacking trip so staying in hostels, and taking public transportation - only buses and trains, so no car :/
Most importantly I would be happy to hear any local food recommendations in each destination if you have any!
I thought of 2 possible options so far:
Option 1:
- Ljubljana (2 nights) - flying into the city, doing the major attractions, walking tours and food.
- Postojna - day trip and then back to Ljubljana and Bled (will probably leave my luggage at the hostel and then pick it back up before heading to Bled).
- Bled + Bohinj (3-4 nights) - this is probably the main open question, currently planning to spend 2 nights in each but hear it might be better to base myself at Bled (read that there's just more to do there than in Bohinj, but Bohinj is cheaper). In that case maybe 3 nights are enough (but if I go to Postojna then 1st day is mostly full already).
I wanna do hiking (thought about Triglav but not too keen on the via-feratta and since I'm solo I prefer to stick to day trips), so I guess one full day would be for the Seven Lakes hike. What are the other recommended ones? 
- Maribor (1 night) - unsure about that, was thinking of getting to Maribor and from there to Zagreb, but I heard Zagreb is skippable (although I wanna catch a football match there). I could also skip Maribor and get to Zagreb straight form Ljubljana - that gives me another day at least in a different destination in Slovenia.
Option 2:
- Ljubljana (2 nights) - same
- Bled + Bohinj (3-4 nights) - same, and then going to Postojna on the way to Piran (maybe also Skocjan, but idk how many caves I would wanna visit in one day :D)
- Piran (1 night) - Get to Croatia from there (to Rovinj/Pula). Piran looks really nice but I am worried it might be similar to what I'll see on the Croatian coast, so it might be better to get more from what Slovenia has to offer that other countries don't? I could be totally wrong of course.
I'm sure there are other destinations I missed, so please let me know. I really wanna get to Logar valley for example as it looks amazing, but it seems it's not very accessible.
 Also I wanted to know how crucial it is to book accommodation (hostels) in advance? (and possibly other stuff too), I'm used to booking hostels 1-2 days in advance when traveling but since this is Europe in peak season I'm guessing I gotta plan ahead more.
Thanks a lot!! :)","{'neg': 0.054, 'neu': 0.828, 'pos': 0.118, 'compound': 0.9927}",0.054,0.828,0.118,0.9927

I am planning with a group of friends a trip in Slovenia in April. So far, this is a rough idea of what I was planning to do. We're gonna do a roadtrip (from Bologna, Italy to Trieste and then stay in Slovenia). This is the plan:

\- day one: arriving in Trieste (evening)

\- day two: Trieste (morning) - Skojcjan Caves (afternoon) - Lubiana (evening and sleep)

\- day three: from Lubiana to Velika Planina + Valle Logarska (sleeping here)

\- day four: from Velika Planina to Bled AND Bohinj (not sure if sleeping here or returning back to Lubiana)

\- day five: Lubiana

I would like some advice about how much time should we spend in each location and if it's right what I planned. I would also like some advice on some typical things to do around these places. It's a nature-oriented trip.

Also: is it worth staying in Velika and Bled/Bohinj for sleeping?

Excuse me for the English post but I couldn’t find any other subReddit to ask Slovenian opinions 😅.

First of all, sorry to hear about the terrible floods situations. Sending positive thoughts and prayers 🙏🏽 

So I am scheduled to take a trip to Lake Bled this Friday and visiting Llubjana in passing on Sunday. We actually plan to stay for 2 nights in Zagreb(Croatia) in between. 

Google maps show that there is no serious problem with our routes as the locations seem to be far away from affected regions. 

But Google and news won’t report everything and anything also so I wanted to ask if it’s alright to be travelling 🧳 in the first place even to regions which is not directly affected. I can imagine that it’s already quite hard for a small country to mobilise all the efforts required. 

The problem is my conducted tour company is saying that there shouldn’t be an issue at all and by now it’s too late to ask for normal cancellation also ( they are obviously not offering full refund for trip they feel has no issues )

It’s kinda sad how underreported this news is however given how devastating the floods looks like.

Do you travel to nearby cities like Zagreb and Trieste in order to fly from there (to Germany, Scandinavia etc)? Are there any other cheap international options from Ljubljana?

Flixbus - Do Slovenians often use Flixbus? I also found this website. [https://www.ap-ljubljana.si/en/international-travel/](https://www.ap-ljubljana.si/en/international-travel/)

Prevoz - Is this used mainly for travels within Slovenia? I guess I need to use Google translate to use the website, but are people open to accept foreigners too? I'm a woman btw.

BlaBlaCar - I used this often in my country. Is it common in Slovenia? Especially to nearby cities like Venice.

Budapest -> Slovenia travel recommendations request,4,6,1693053407.0,"Budapest -> Slovenia travel recommendations request Hi everyone.

Then I noticed that driving would take a bit less time on Google maps and through of the idea of driving instead.

A few questions as a result:

2. Can you recommend a car rental company to use in both Budapest and Slovenia?

Hello/Zdravo, I am planning to visit Slovenia in the last week of August for 7-9 nights . 
I have made a list of places I would like to visit based on videos/blogs and reddit threads.
I will be traveling solo and I do not drive so I will be traveling by public transport. 
I’m slightly stuck at what would be the best place to choose as a base and stay a couple of nights so I can cover the following places without having to change accommodations frequently. 
Please could you suggest an area that fulfill this criteria

1. Lake Jasna and Kranjska Gora
2.Pericnik Waterfall 

Group 5 
1. Kranj
2. Logar Valley


Q: Considering I want to cover all of these places without moving hotels frequently would Bled be a suitable place to stay at for 5 nights and cover each of these groups each day? 

Q: Is this possible with buses/ trains?

Q: Should I split my stay to 2 places which would help with  commute 

Q: should I do either Tolmin or Vintgar if they’re similar?

Q: should i add or remove from this list?

Apart from this I’ll be staying in Ljubljana for 2 nights and doing Postojna and Predjama 

I am not looking to add coastal places in this trip

Or a 3rd option we can get a huge house/villa on the river in Lake Bled and do a day trip to Ljubljana. We will be in Hallstatt for 3 days before this though so maybe its good to be in the city for a bit after.

Travelling to Slovenia: any feedback on my itinerary?,38,47,1645356778.0,"Travelling to Slovenia: any feedback on my itinerary? Hello dear Slovenians,

I'm from Belgium and I'm currently planning a 2 week trip with my partner in August to your beautiful country. We'll be renting a car to get around.

We're mostly interested in the nature of Slovenia and prefer to take our time to travel rather than trying to see as much as possible.

I've created the following itinerary:

Day 1: Brussels Airport -> Ljubljana Airport -> Ljubljana: we'll be arriving in the late afternoon so I feel like it's best to just pick up the car and take a short drive to Ljubljana to spend the night.

Day 2: Ljubljana - Piran/Koper

Day 3: Piran/Koper

Day 4: Piran/Koper -> Bovec (visit Tolmin Gorge on our way)

Day 5: Bovec

Day 6: Bovec

Day 7: Bovec -> Kransjka Gora (through Vrsic Pass)

Day 8: Kransjka Gora

Day 9: Kransjka Gora: Lake Jasna

Day 10: Kransjka Gora -> Bled/Bohinj

Day 11: Bled/Bohinj: visit Bled

Day 12: Bled/Bohinj: Visit Bohinj

Day 13: Bled/Bohinj: visit Vintgar Gorge -> Ljubljana

Day 14: Ljubljana: Spend a day in Ljubljana

Day 15: Ljubljana -> Brussels


Any opinions on this itinerary? Are we travelling too slow? Should we spend some time in the east of the country instead? Should we skip Piran/Koper and go elsewhere instead? Are we spending too many nights in Ljubljana?

My reason for spending so much time in Bovec, Kransjka Gora and Bled/Bohinj is that it just wows me when I'm looking at pictures. Also I feel like it shouldn't be a problem at all to fill our days there with hiking, canyoning/rafting/kayakking, etc. without having to worry about leaving in time for our next destination.

Should I stay in Koper or Piran? And Bohinj or Bled? It's only a 20 minute drive so I feel like we can just stay in one of the 2.

Honestely any feedback and tips (food, activities, extra places to stay,...) are welcome.

Thank you in advance!

Day 2: Kranj -> Predjama Castle -> Rakov Skocjan -> Piran

Day 3: Piran, Koper, Portoroz. Not sure if we'll even need a full day here.

Day 4: Piran -> Skocjan Caves -> Dobrovo

Day 5: Dobrovo -> Tolmin Gorges -> Bovec

Day 6: Day in Bovec, walking/hiking/water activities. 

Day 7: Day in Bovec, walking/hiking/water activities. Potentially drive back to Kobarid. Perhaps get rid of this day all together.

Day 8: Bovec -> Vrsic Pass -> Zelenci -> Planica Zipline -> Martuljski Waterfalls -> Spend the night in this area

Day 9: Area -> Pericnik Waterfalls -> Vintgar Gorge -> Bled -> Bohinj

Day 10: Bohinj

Day 11: Bohinj -> Maribor

Day 12: Maribor -> Ptuj -> Maribor

Day 13: Maribor -> Ljubljana

Day 14: Spend a day in Ljubljana

Day 15: Ljubljana -> Home

If I scrap a day in Bovec and Piran I'd even have more time to go elsewhere. I'll think about it.","{'neg': 0.004, 'neu': 0.917, 'pos': 0.079, 'compound': 0.9903}",0.004,0.917,0.079,0.9903

* Postojna cave ( Predjama castle )
* Skocjan cave
* Lake Bled ( Bled castle )
* Soteska  Vintgar
* Anything you recommend

Also recommendations for Ljubljana in terms of breakfast/dinner, cocktail/bar and in general things to do while there.

My initial idea was that we visit both caves before we come to Ljubljana but I am worried that might not be possible due to reservation times. So how would you configure your 3 day trip to Slovenia to maximize exploration but also have time for enjoying coffee, eating and drinking in Ljubljana.

Solo Traveling for 5 Days: Car Rental or Campervan Recommended?,3,3,1692040269.0,"Solo Traveling for 5 Days: Car Rental or Campervan Recommended? Greetings!

I am traveling by myself to your beautiful country next month and am looking to do a 5 to 6 day road trip.  I have definitely decided on renting a vehicle for ease of getting around to all the different sights but I am currently trying to decide if it may be worth the cost of renting a motorhome or if it makes more sense to rent a car.

I very much love the outdoors so the thought of renting a motorhome sounds ideal in that I won't have to worry about transferring my luggage in and out of a car to a hotel/hostel each day.  I also thought this might allow for greater flexibility if I decide that I want to spend more time in one place than I had originally intended, or, if I wanted to change plans last minute.

Of course I am thinking it will likely be more costly to rent a motorhome versus a car but was wondering if anyone had recommendations as to which they think may be a better option for a solo traveler?

It looks like there is an extensive network of motorhome campsites to park at overnight but I wasn't sure how much these costs per night and additionally, if reservations typically needed to be made in advance?

Thanks so much for any suggestions/advice, they are greatly appreciated!

However E652 is marked as a toll road if I use the route with tolls, and without tolls it doesn't say it's a toll road but since it's the same road, is it really without tolls?

And if I accidentally do end up on the highway, what is my best course of action? Can I buy the vignette at the nearest gas station if that would happen or I am screwed and the first camera will get me and I will get a fine?

Should I bring or use these charging stations in Slovenia upon travel?,3,10,1670457252.0,"Should I bring or use these charging stations in Slovenia upon travel? I have these charging stations from the USA, only compatible with 110-25v. I'm certain that all Slovenian homes support **230v** **- 50Hz** in their electrical grid. I wanted to use both devices to charge my laptop, phone, and cameras as well as have a portable plug outlet on the go while staying in a hotel or plugging it in public spaces where plug sockets are available.

Also, this  item isn't available outside the US. Japan also has the same item with only 2 prongs without a ground. I've seen videos of tech YouTubers based  in the US reviewing both chargers as part of the GanPrime lineup released by Anker eg. ([Anker 727](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXkyhRhRN9g) & [Anker 615](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CueEw0BrGoo)), as pictured have built-in AC outlets (Type B), only capable of supplying **125v - 60Hz**  when plugged into a socket, I think this product is made for Japanese or American consumers only, for some reason Anker didn't remake both  products for other countries.

I  bought a step-down transformer from Australia (240 > 110v) during the time I was there, would that also be required before traveling to Ljubljana or Maribor to prevent a blown fuse and electrical fires  during a potential visit for using both charging stations:

I'm from the Netherlands and in a few weeks time me and my family will be visiting your beautiful country for our holiday. We've visited before, but this time we're thinking about using our electric car to make the trip. We are staying in Lendava, in the east.

I was hoping that you could maybe help me with some questions.

- When I check my app with charging stations it seems that there will be no problem finding enough places to charge to reach our destination. One issue could be that in some places the charging stations are often not working. Do any of you know if that is often the case around Slovenia (or particularly the east)? In that case we might need to play it safer with how often we charge.

-  I have a charging card from a company called Plug Surfing. Their card can be used internationally, but do you think it would be safer to get something local from Slovenia as well? If so, which type of card do you suggest?

- Are there any other things I should know about, like non-standard charging cables that I should have?

And finally, if any of you have any nice suggestions for places to visit around Lendava then I would love to hear those as well :)

I'm planning on visiting Ljubljana and I was wandering about the current status of the travel restrictions.

But I'm not sure if the RVT is required for accommodation.

I'm trying to plan to a trip to Slovenia and then see Venice at the end of May/beginning of June.

1. Flixbus -- if I search 'today', I can see that it goes from Ljubljana to Padua and then a train to Venice.
2. Eurorail -- if search 'today', I can see a 9:22am train from Ljubljana that, I think, goes up to Villach Austria (?) and then a bus from Villach down to Venice.   It seems kind of weird to me that there isn't a train that's more direct from Ljubljana to Venice.

Either of these would be fine for me, but I search the last week of May or the first week of June on either site I get no results.  Am I just looking out too far?

Would it be possible to rent a car, with an international driving license, in Ljubljana and drive, one way, to Venice?

Travel advice for foodies,6,11,1567895884.0,"Travel advice for foodies Živjo!

I'll be in Slovenia next week (by car), already did a lot of research and still have some questions.

The first is regarding the highway vignette: I'll enter from Italy, is it necessary to have the vignette on the windshield before entering Slovenia or is it legal to buy it at the first point of sale after crossing the boarder (I believe almost every petrol station sells it?!).

Since it will be rainy next week I decided to visit a thermal spa. I found [this list of spas](https://www.slovenia.info/en/things-to-do/spas-and-health-resorts) but I'm still not sure which to choose (Rimske is my favourite so far). Thermal spas don't seem to be as traditional as a lot of baths in Hungary which were build or influenced by Romans or/and Ottomans. So I'm looking for a bath to relax, a sauna should be available too. Maybe here is somebody who already visited some thermal spas in Slovenia and can give an advice.

I read a lot about that there are a lot of organic farms in Slovenia but it's always pretty vague. Is there something like a catalog of them, maybe from an association? Can you give concrete recommendations? Is the Ecological Market, which takes place every Wednesday at the Pogačar Square, worth a visit?

Further culinary recommendations are highly appreciated: Beer (will visit Pivoteka Za popen't in Ljubljana), Chocolate (thought about visiting Zotter in nearby Austria), Bakeries (will visit Pekarna OSEM in Ljubljana), Restaurants (thought about visiting Strelec, Hisa Franco, Gostilna Dela...).

I need some travel tips,1,4,1468962729.0,"I need some travel tips Hello, guys. This september I'm planning to go on my first backpacking trip and I choose to do it in your country. I will have aroung 500-600 euros and roughly my plan is to go from Ljubljana to Bled. 

So do you have any tips involving places near my travel route that I should visit (and places that I should visit in Ljubljana), cheap and clean hostels, food that I must try, things that I should do? I don't know exactly how many days I'll stay, maybe around 5,6. All suggestions are welcomed.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.945, 'pos': 0.055, 'compound': 0.6249}",0.0,0.945,0.055,0.6249

Do you guys have any comforting words about slovenia for me? What is it like down there? Are you friendly? Any students I can talk to?
